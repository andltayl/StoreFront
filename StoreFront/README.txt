Description: This program Is a simple storefront inventory management system.

There is little to no error checking in this program simply because the point was to demonstrate the use 
of C# not to make a super robust idiot proof inventory system.

I made the decision to keep all of the code in a single file because I couldnt figure out how to
properly split it up. I'll figure that out soon.

To run the program open the .csproj file in VS17, compile, and run. 
Alternatively just compile the Program.cs file and run on its own.
